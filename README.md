# 1-2-3..-Fingers-Up-Bring-Changes-To-The-LED-Intensity

This project is to control the LED light intensity using the number of fingers (1/2//3/4..) using opencv, cvzone and BoltIoT 
i.e based on the number of figures we show during video capture by the system it will changes the light intensity of the LED 
using the bolt API this enables the smart control of LED's intensity using computer vision
